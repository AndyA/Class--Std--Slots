Make connect, disconnect (and possibly has_slots) accept an anon array of signal names to work with multiple signals at once.

Devise some examples and write an article
    Software ICs - simple logic simulations, irony of OO Software IC metaphor
    File walker - emit signals for files, directories
    XML parser?
    Language preprocessor - parser fires different signals for preprocessor lines, comments, normal lines
    Web stuff?
    UI stuff? (obvious but maybe still useful)
