=head1 DESCRIPTION

Conventionally the ways in which objects of different classes can interact with
each other is designed into those classes; changes to that behaviour require
either changes to the classes in question or the creation of subclasses.

Signals and slots allow objects to be wired together dynamically at run time in
ways that weren't necessarily anticipated by the designers of the classes. For
example consider a class that manages time consuming downloads:

    package My::Downloader;
    use Class::Std;
    {
        sub do_download {
            my $self = shift;
            # ... do something time consuming ...
        }
    }

For a particular application it might be desirable to be able to display a progress
report as the download progresses. Unfortunately C<My::Downloader> isn't wired to
allow that. We could improve C<My::Downloader> by providing a stub function that's
called periodically during a download:

    package My::Downloader::Better;
    use Class::Std;
    {
        sub progress {
            # do nothing
        }

        sub do_download {
            my $self = shift;
            # ... do something time consuming periodically calling progress() ...
        }
    }

Then we could subclass C<My::Downloader::Better> to update a display:

    package My::Downloader::Verbose;
    use base qw(My::Downloader::Better);
    use Class::Std;
    {
        sub progress {
            my $self = shift;
            my $done = shift;
            print "$done % done\n";
        }
    }

That's not bad - but we had to create a subclass - and we'd have to arrange for it
to be created instead of a C<My::Downloader::Better> anytime we want to use it. If
displaying the progress involved updating a progress bar in a GUI we'd need to
embed a reference to the progress bar in each instance of C<My::Downloader::Verbose>.

Instead we could extend C<My::Downloader::Better> to call an arbitrary callback via
a supplied code reference each time C<progress()> was called ... but then we have to
implement the interface that allows the callback to be defined. If we also want
notifications of retries and server failures we'll need still more callbacks. Tedious.

Or we could write C<My::Downloader::Lovely> like this:

    package My::Downloader::Lovely;
    use Class::Std;
    use Class::Std::Slots;
    {
        signals qw(
            progress_update
            server_failure
        );

        sub do_download {
            my $self = shift;
            # ... do something time consuming periodically emitting
            # a progress_update signal like this:
            for (@ages) {
                $self->do_chunk();
                $self->progress_update($done++);
            }
        }
    }

and use it like this:

    use My::Downloader::Lovely;

    my $lovely = My::Downloader::Lovely->new();
    $lovely->do_download();

That behaves just like the original C<My::Downloader> example. Now let's hook up the progress
display - we're using an imaginary GUI toolkit:

    use My::Downloader::Lovely;
    use Pretty::ProgressBar;

    my $lovely = My::Downloader::Lovely->new();
    my $pretty = Pretty::ProgressBar->new();

    # Now the clever bit - hook them together. Whenever the
    # progress_update signal is emitted it'll call
    # $pretty->update_bar($done);
    $lovely->connect('progress_update', $pretty, 'update_bar');

    # Do the download with style
    $lovely->do_download();

We didn't have to subclass or modify C<My::Downloader::Lovely> and we didn't have to clutter its
interface with methods to allow callbacks to be installed.

Each signal can be connected to many slots simultaneously; perhaps we want some debug to show
up on the console too:

    use My::Downloader::Lovely;
    use Pretty::ProgressBar;

    my $lovely = My::Downloader::Lovely->new();
    my $pretty = Pretty::ProgressBar->new();

    # Now the clever bit - hook them together. Whenever the
    # progress_update signal is emitted it'll call
    # $pretty->update_bar($done);
    $lovely->connect('progress_update', $pretty, 'update_bar');

    # Add an anon slot to display progress on the console too
    $lovely->connect('progress_update', sub { print 'Done: ', $_[0], "\n"; });

    # Do the download with style
    $lovely->do_download();

Each slot can either be a subroutine reference or an object reference and method name. Anonymous
slots are particularly useful for debugging but they also provide a lightweight way to extend
the behaviour of an existing class.

Only classes that emit signals need use C<Class::Std::Slots> - any method in any class can be
used as a slot.

=head2 Signals?

The signals we refer to here are unrelated to operating system signals. That's why the class is
called C<Class::Std::Slots> instead of Class::Std::Signals.

=head2 Further reading

Sarah Thompson has produced a generic signals and slots library for C++:

L<http://sigslot.sourceforge.net/>

The accompanying documentation includes an excellent exploration of the benefits of signals and slots.

Qt (C++ again) uses signals and slots extensively. Consult the Qt documentation and in particular
the section on signals and slots for more information:

L<http://doc.trolltech.com/3.3/signalsandslots.html>

Other UI toolkits including NextStep / Cocoa / GNUStep use mechanisms similar to signals and slots
in all but name.

=head1 INTERFACE

C<Class::Std::Slots> is designed to be used in conjunction with C<Class::Std>. It I<may> work
with classes not based on C<Class::Std> but this is untested. To use it add
C<use Class::Std::Slots> just after C<use Class::Std>

    package My::Class;
    use Class::Std
    use Class::Std::Slots           # <-- add this
    {
        signals qw(                 # <-- add this
            started
            progress
            finished
            retry
        );

        sub my_method {
            my $self = shift;
            # etc
        }
    }

and add a call to C<signals> to declare any signals your class will emit.

C<Class::Std::Slots> will add five public methods to your class: C<signals>, C<connect>,
C<disconnect>, C<has_slots> and C<emit_signal>.

=head2 Methods created automatically

The following subroutines are installed in any class that uses the C<Class::Std::Slots> module.

=over

=item C<signals( signals )>

Declare the list of signals that a class can emit. Multiple calls to C<signals> are allowed
but each signal should be declared only once. It is an error to redeclare a signal even in
a subclass or to declare a signal with the same name as a method.

Once declared signals may be called as members of the declaring class and any subclasses.
To emit a signal simply call it:

    $my_obj->started('Starting download');

Any arguments passed to the signal will be passed to any slots registered with it. Signals
never have a return value - any return values from slots are silently discarded.

=item C<connect($sig_name, ...)>

Create a connection between a signal and a slot. Connections are made between objects (i.e.
class instances) rather than between classes. To connect the signal C<started> to a slot
called C<show_status> do something like this:

    $my_thing->connect('started', $uitools, 'show_status');

Whenever C<$my_thing> emits C<started> C<show_status> will be called with any
arguments that were passed to C<started>.

To call a non-member subroutine (which may be an anonymous subroutine or closure) do this:

    $my_thing->connect('debug_out', sub {
        print "@_\n";
    });

Anonymous subroutines are also useful to patch up impedence mismatches between the slot
method and the signal. For example if the signal C<progress> is called with two arguments
(the current progress and the expected total) but the desired slot C<show_progress>
expects to be passed a percentage use something like this:

    $my_thing->connect('progress', sub {
        my ($pos, $all) = @_;
        my $percent = int($pos * 100 / $all);
        $uitools->show_progress($percent);
    });

A slot may be connected to multiple signals at the same time by passing an array reference
in place of the signal name:

    $my_thing->connect(['debug_out', 'warning_out'], $logger, 'trace');

Normally a slot is passed exactly the arguments that were passed to the signal - so when
C<< $this_obj->some_signal >> has been connected to C<< $that_obj->some_slot >> emitting the
signal like this:

    $this_obj->some_signal(1, 2, 'Here we go');

will cause C<some_slot> to be called like this:

    $that_obj->some_slot(1, 2, 'Here we go');

Sometimes it is useful to be able to write generic slot functions that can be connected
to many different signals and that are capable of interacting with the object that emitted
the signal. The C<reveal_source> option modifies the argument list of the slot function so
that the first argument is a reference to a hash that describes the source of the signal:

    $this_obj->connect('first_signal',  $generic, 'smart_slot', { reveal_source => 1 });
    $this_obj->connect('second_signal', $generic, 'smart_slot', { reveal_source => 1 });
    $that_obj->connect('first_signal',  $generic, 'smart_slot', { reveal_source => 1 });

When C<< $this_obj->first_signal >> is emitted C<< $generic->smart_slot >> will be called with
this hash ref as its first argument:

    {
        source  => $this_obj,
        signal  => 'first_signal',
        options => { reveal_source => 1 }
    }

When C<< $this_obj->second_signal >> is emitted the hash will look like this:

    {
        source  => $this_obj,
        signal  => 'second_signal',
        options => { reveal_source => 1 }
    }

Note that the options hash passed to C<connect> is passed to the slot. This is so that
additional user defined options can be used to influence the behaviour of the slot
function.

The options recognised by C<connect> itself are:

=over

=item reveal_source

Modify slot arg list to include a hash that describes the source of the signal.

=item strong

Normally the reference to the object containing the slot method is weakened (by
calling C<Scalar::Util::weaken> on it). Set this option to make the reference
strong - which means that once an object has been connected to no other
references to it need be kept.

Anonymous subroutine slots are always strongly referred to - so there is no
need to specify the C<strong> option for them.

=item undeclared

Allow a connection to be made to an undefined signal. It is possible for an object
to emit arbitrary signals by calling C<emit_signal>. Normally C<connect> checks that
a signal has been declared before connecting to it (bugs caused by slightly misnamed
signals are particularly frustrating). This flag overrides that check and makes it
your responsibility to get the signal name right.

=back

=item C<disconnect($sig_name, ...)>

Break signal / slot connections. All connections are broken when the signalling
object is destroyed. To break a connection at any other time use:

    $obj->disconnect('a_signal', $other_obj, 'method');

To break all connections from a signal to slots in a particular object use:

    $obj->disconnect('a_signal', $other_obj);

To break all connections for a particular signal use:

    $obj->disconnect('a_signal');

And finally to break all connections from a signalling object:

    $obj->disconnect();

In other words each additional argument increases the specificity of the connections
that are targetted.

As with connect a reference to an array of signal names may be passed:

    $obj->disconnect(['sig1', 'sig2', 'sig3'], $my_slotz);

Note that it is not possible to disconnect an anonymous slot subroutine without disconnecting
all other slots connected to the same signal:

    $obj->connect('a_signal', sub { });
    $obj->connect('a_signal', $other_obj, 'a_slot');

    # Can't target the anon slot individually
    $obj->disconnect('a_signal');

If this proves to be an enbearable limitation I'll do something about it.

=item C<emit_signal($sig_name, ...)>

It's not always possible to pre-declare all the signals an object may emit. For example an XML
processor may emit signals corresponding to the names of tags in the parsed XML; in that case
it would be overly restrictive to require pre-declaration of the signals.

To emit an arbitrary signal - which may or may not have been declared - call emit() directly
like this:

    $self->emit_signal('made_up_signal', @sig_args);

Pass C<connect> the C<undeclared> option to connect to an undeclared signal.

Multiple signals may be emitted at the same time (or rather one after another) by passing a
reference to an array of signal names:

    $self->emit_signal(['sig1', 'sig2'], @sig_args);
    
=item C<has_slots($sig_name)>

In cases where emitting a signal involves costly computation C<has_slots>
can be called to check whether a signal has any connected slots and if
not skip both the expensive computation and the signal call.

    if ($self->has_slots('expensive_signal') {
        my @sig_args = $self->do_expensive_sums();
        $self->expensive_signal(@sig_args);
    }

Note that there is no benefit in guarding simple signal calls with a call
to has_slots:

    # Don't do this
    $self->cheap_signal() if $self->has_slots('cheap_signal');

    # Instead just do
    $self->cheap_signal();

As usual a reference to an array of signal names may be passed in which
case C<has_slots> will return a true value if any of the named signals
has connected slots.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item C<< Invalid signal name '%s' >>

Signal names have the same syntax as identifier names - you've tried to
use a name that contains a character that isn't legal in an identifier.

=item C<< Signal name must be a scalar or an array reference >>

Either pass a single signal name like this:

    $obj->has_slots('sig1');

Or pass a reference to an array of signal names like this:

    $obj->has_slots(['sig1', 'sig2', 'sig3']);

This applies to all methods that accept a signal name.

=item C<< Signal '%s' undefined >>

Signals are declared by calling the C<signals> subroutine. You're
attempting to connect to an undefined signal.

=item C<< Signal '%s' must be invoked as a method >>

Signals are fired using normal method call syntax. To fire a signal
do something like

    $my_obj->some_signal('Args', 'go', 'here');

=item C<< Attempt to re-enter signal '%s' >>

Signals are not allowed to fire themselves directly or indirectly. This
is an intentional limitation. The ease with which signals can be
connected to slots in complex patterns makes it easy to introduce
unintended loops of mutually triggered signals.

=item C<< Usage: $source->connect($sig_name, $dst_obj, $dst_method [, { options }]) >>

C<connect> can be called either like this:

    $my_obj->connect('some_signal', $other_obj, 'slot_to_fire');

or like this:

    $my_obj->connect('some_signal', sub { print "Slot fired" });

In either case an anonymous hash containing options may be passed as an
additional argument.

=item C<< Slot '%s' not handled by %s >>

You're attempting to connect to a slot that isn't implemented by
the target object. Slots are normal member functions.

=item C<< disconnect must be called as a member >>

Disconnect should be called like this:

    # Disconnect one slot
    $my_obj->disconnect('some_signal', $other_obj, 'slot_name');

or like this:

    # Disconnect all slots in the specified object
    $my_obj->disconnect('some_signal', $other_obj);

or like this:

    # Disconnect all slots for a signal
    $my_obj->disconnect('some_signal');

or like this:

    # Disconnect all slots for all signals
    $my_obj->disconnect();

=item C<< Signal '%s' aready declared >>

You're attempting to declare a signal that already exists. This may be
because it has been declared as a signal or because the signal name
clashes with a method name.

Note that it is illegal to redeclare a signal in a subclass if a parent
already declares the signal. Since signals can't be declared to do
anything other than be a signal it makes no sense to redeclare a
signal in a subclass.

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Class::Std::Slots requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

C<Class::Std>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

Only known to work in conjuction with C<Class::Std>. Only tested when used
with C<Class::Std> in the way shown in this document.

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

No bugs have been reported.

Connecting the same slot to a signal multiple times actually makes multiple
connections and therefore invokes the slot as many times as it was registered
when the signal is emitted. Arguably only one connection to each slot should
be allowed. Let me know.

There is currently no way to disconnect an anonymous sub slot without also
disconnecting other slots from the same signal.

C<Class::Std::Slots> replaces the DESTROY sub injected into the caller's
namespace by C<Class::Std> and arranges to call the original destructor
after doing its own cleanup. This may interact badly with other modules that
also replace the C<Class::Std> destructor - although it is designed to ensure
it always calls whatever destructor it finds. Suggestions for a neater way
of chaining our destructor gratefully received.

I'm not sure that the code that prevents signals from re-entering (i.e. it's
an error to emit a signal if that signal is already being handled) might not
prevent some (fairly complex) techniques. If this proves to be a limitation
in practice it would be possible to add an option to each connection that
would allow that connection to be re-entrant.
